                        <p>Charlie's issues quickly cleared away. He was back to running, playing and being full of life. Mary had been devoting a significant amount of time to Charlie and couldn’t keep up with all the cooking anymore. Paul and Mary decided to look into different solutions in the market, but all they could find were frozen meals, packaged in difficult to use plastic.</p>

They met with a vet nutritionist and began working on fresh recipes of what they called puppy meatloaf, we call Puploaf. Partnering with local chefs they brought their healthy recipes to life with popping fresh flavor.</p>
